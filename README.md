# Horrible-Code-Project

This project is a simple calculator designed to demonstrate good and bad coding practices.
The goal is to compare a version of the program with good coding practices the (`good_calculator.py`) with the
other version the program with bad coding practices the (`bad_calculator.py`)
to practice writing clean, maintainable code.

## Project Files

- `good_calculator.py` – skeleton for the good version of the calculator  
- `bad_calculator.py` – skeleton for the bad version of the calculator  git add README.md




## Principles Demonstrated
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. KISS (keeping it simple)

Good version: 
    Each functions was implemented to perform one simple task. By following this principle 
    this version of the code is easy to follow and it also avoids any unnecessary complex codes. 


Bad Version:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. DRY (Dnt Repeat Yourself)

Good version: 
    Each function that includes mathematical operations is only written once and it is not resued in 
    anywhere later in the code. 


Bad Version:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Single Responsibility Principle

Good version: 
    The mathematical functions only perform the necessary calculations, and errors such as dividing 
    by zero and are handled appropriately. The main function manages user input and output.
    Implementing this helps to keep the code organized and easy to read. 


Bad Version:
